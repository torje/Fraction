Fraction
========
The fraction class is intended to be a reference to what operators is useful to overload for scalars and a readable example of such. 

For the time being it should work with small integers in numerators and denominators. I think I avoid subtracting larger numbers from small, but I do not check for integer overflow during operations, so not very usable at the moment.
